/*
 Summary:
> assert is a development tool to catch logic errors and bugs early.
> It terminates the program when the condition fails and provides debugging information.
> Itâ€™s meant to be used during development and debugging, not in production.
> Once the program is stable, you can disable assertions using the NDEBUG macro to
  prevent them from affecting production performance.
> In essence, assert helps to guarantee that the internal logic of your program behaves
  as expected during development, ensuring stability and correctness before you release
  the program to production.
